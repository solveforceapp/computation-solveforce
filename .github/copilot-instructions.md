# Copilot Instructions for computation-solveforce

## Project Overview
This project is currently a single static HTML file: `index.html`. There are no frameworks, build tools, or backend components. All content and logic reside in this file.

## Guidance for AI Coding Agents
- **Single-File Structure:** All markup, scripts, and styles are in `index.html` unless new files are explicitly added.
- **No Automation:** There are no build, test, or deployment scripts. All edits are made directly to `index.html`.
- **Extending the Project:**
  - For JavaScript, create `main.js` and link it in `index.html`.
  - For styles, create `styles.css` and link it in `index.html`.
  - If introducing frameworks or build tools, document the setup in a new `README.md`.
- **Documentation:** Update this file and add a `README.md` as the project grows to document new conventions, workflows, or architectural decisions.

## Example Patterns
- To add interactivity: create `main.js` and link it in `index.html`.
- To add styles: create `styles.css` and link it in `index.html`.

## Next Steps
- As the project evolves, update this file to reflect new patterns, workflows, or architectural decisions.
